# CSCI 2041 - Advanced Programming Principles in Ocaml

Ocaml is a functional programming language used to introduce a higher-level approach to programming over complex data.  The representation is rather abstract when compared to other known languages (C, Java, Python).  Concepts taught in this course were recursion, high-order thinking, infinite data objects, search-based programming, and modularity.

The work displayed on this GitHub is the work I had to submit for the class.  Feel free to ask any questions regarding the code.
