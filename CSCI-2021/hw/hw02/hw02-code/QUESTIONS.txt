PROBLEM 1: Memory in diagram.c
==============================

  For each of the C blocks below, give a memory diagram of the block
  indicating memory locations and contents of cells. These blocks appear
  in the file `diagram.c' which you can modify to print results if you
  want to verify your answers.

  MAKE SURE to accurately express the standard sizes for each of the
  kinds of variables ON A 64-BIT MACHINE in your diagrams by placing
  them at appropriate memory addresses that are tightly packed. A
  reminder: on 64-bit machines, all pointers are 64 bits / 8 bytes.

PROBLEM 2: C Text and Binary I/O
================================

  Examine the code blocks below which involve I/O with text and binary
  data. Each example contains a logic error which will lead to
  problems. Describe what the correction is and provide code if needed.


A
~

  ,----
  |   FILE *fin = fopen(...,"r");
  |   int buf[4];             // store 4 ints from file in this array
  |   fread(buf, 4, 1, fin);  // want to read 4 ints from fin into buf (ERROR)
  `----
  Describe why the marked line is an error and provide a correction.
  There are less than four ints from fin into buf.

B
~

  ,----
  |   FILE *fout = fopen(...,"w");
  |   int length = ...;
  |   double *buf = malloc(length*sizeof(double));
  |
  |   ...;                           // code to fill in buf with values omitted
  |
  |   for(int i=0; i<length; i++){   // write all doubles from buf to file one at a time
  |     fwrite(buf, sizeof(double), 1, fout);   // error
  |   }
  `----


C
~

  ,----
  |   FILE *fin = fopen(...,"r");
  |   char buf[100];             // store up to 100 characters
  |   int pos = 0;
  |   while(1){
  |     int result = fscanf(fin, "%d", &buf[pos]);
  |     if(result == EOF){
  |       break;
  |     }
  |     pos++;
  |   }
  |   // error in logic, may overflow buf: why?
  `----

  | // read two binary ints from given file, return pointer to them
  | int *read_2_ints(char *fname){
  |   FILE *fin = fopen(fname,"r");
  |   int buf[2];
  |   fread(buf, sizeof(int), 2, fin);
  |   fclose(fin);
  |   return buf;  // compile error
  | }

PROBLEM 3: Linked List Application
==================================

  This problem deals with small application spread across three files in
  a standard C project arrangement:
  - list.h (header file) declares types and functions and is
    `#include''d by the C files
  - list_funcs.c defines linked list functions
  - list_main.c has a usable main() function
  You will need to compile the two C files together to produce an
  executable program as in
  ,----
  | gcc list_main.c list_funcs.c
  `----

  Study the code in these and answer the following questions.

  NOTE: There is a bug in the 'insert' functionality that is the subject
  of discussion in Lab02. It causes insertion to report failures in most
  cases. Make sure to correct this bug during lab or subsequently.


A
~

  In `list_main.c', a function related to `scanf()' is used to read
  input. Look up this function and describe its first argument. Also
  mention what else this function is good for and what it returns when
  the end of input is reached.

  The first argument is the pointer to a FILE object that identifies the stream.
  The input reads formatted input from a stream. The return value returns the
  number of input items successfully matched and assigned.

B
~

  In `list_main.c', a function from the standard C library is used to
  compare strings (character arrays). Describe this function, how to
  call it, and its return value. Describe how it is used to identify
  commands typed by a user in list_main.c. Also determine whether this
  function gives any guidance on the sorting order of strings.

  strcmp compares the string pointed to by str1 and the string pointed to by
  str2.  You call it in the form "int strcmp(const char *str1, const char *str2)".
  If its return value < 0, then str1 < str2. If the value is > 0, then str1 > str2.
  If the value = 0, then str1 = str2.  If the command given matches the
  commands inputted by the user, then the match is a success. This function can
  sort strings by their characters.

C
~

  Examine where a `list_t' variable is declared in `list_main.c'.  Is
  the list a stack variable or one that has memory dynamically allocated
  with malloc() and then subsequently free()'d?  Examine the convention
  of the `list_init()' function in `list_funcs.c'.  Does this function
  allocate any memory or simply operate on an existing list_t? How is it
  used with the `list_t' declared in `main()'?

  It seems that 'list' has memory dynamically allocated for it because of the use
  of the ampersand. 'list_init()' allocates memory that is initialized. There will
  be a new list that is initialized in 'main()'.

D
~

  Examine the `list.h' header file. Describe the C structs that you see
  there. What fields does a `list_t' have? What fields does a `node_t'
  have?  What is the maximum length of strings that can be stored in the
  linked list according to the definitions of the types?


E
~

  Examine functions such as `list_insert()' in `list_funcs.c' which
  allocate nodes. How are they allocated?  How is the size of nodes
  determined so that the correct amount of space is allocated? Where and
  how is the space allocated for nodes de-allocated (which function)?


PROBLEM 4: Debugging the get command
====================================

A Run Normally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The linked list application has some bugs in its `get N' command that
  stem from bad code.  Run the `list_main' application and enter the
  following commands and report what happens.

  ,----
  | > ./list_main
  | list> insert apple
  | list> insert banana
  | list> get 0
  | list> get 1
  | list> get 5
  `----

  Paste your results below and identify a dreaded error which commonly
  occurs in C programs.

  list> insert apple
  insert failed
  list> insert banana
  insert failed
  list> get 0
  0: apple
  list> get 1
  1: banana
  list> get 5
  Segmentation fault

B Valgrind and Debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Memory errors are easy to introduce while developing C programs.
  Luckily, Linux systems come with a handy tool for helping to diagnose
  memory errors called *Valgrind*.  It is installed on lab machines and
  should be installed if not. Enter the commands below and observe the
  output.  Note how easy it is to start a program "under" Valgrind in
  the first line.
  ,----
  | > valgrind ./list_main          # start program "under" valgrind to report memory problems
  | list> insert apple
  | list> insert banana
  | list> get 0
  | list> get 1
  | list> get 5
  `----
  In the LONG output that comes up, look for lines that mention any of
  the List Application source files such as `list_main.c' and
  `list_funcs.c'.  These will often have lines associated with them as
  well like `list_main.c:42' for line 42 of `list_main.c'.

  Copy the Valgrind output that indicate which C source lines triggered
  the program error below. This is where one should begin a search for a
  fix.


C Fix the get command and test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Use the clues you found from Valgrind to figure out which part of the
  List application to modify. After changing the code, check that it
  behaves correctly. You can verify this as well by running the
  automated tests, especially test 3 which can be run alone with the
  command:
  ,----
  | > make test testnum=3
  `----
  If there are still memory errors, the Valgrind output will be shown
  for this test.

  Identify which code needs to change made and show your fixes below.


PROBLEM 5: Add list_contains()
==============================

  The files for the linked list application have places indicating where
  a `list_contains()' function and a `contains' command should be
  implemented.  Complete this implementation which will require you to
  write some C code in both `list_funcs.c' and `list_main.c'.  It will
  also require you to do some string comparisons.

  Paste the following below for you answer
  1. Your code for list_contains()
  2. Code you added to main() to enable the "contains" command to work
  3. A sample session of the main application where several inserts are
     done and contains is used to show some items are present and not
     present

  You can check that the program works properly by running the automated
  tests with the provided Makefile. Test #3 checks the 'contains'
  functionality and passing all tests will look like the following.

  ,----
  | > make test
  | gcc -Wall -g -c list_main.c
  | gcc -Wall -g -c list_funcs.c
  | gcc -Wall -g -o list_main list_main.o list_funcs.o list.h
  | ./testy test_list_main.org
  | ============================================================
  | == test_list_main.org : list_main application tests
  | == Running 4 / 4 tests
  | 1)  Print then Exit      : ok
  | 2)  Insert 3 and Print   : ok
  | 3)  Get Command          : ok
  | 4)  Contains Items       : ok
  | ============================================================
  | RESULTS: 4 / 4 tests passed
  `----


Information: Command Echoing
============================

  Interactive applications like `list_main' are made much more useful if
  they can be "scripted": made to perform without the need of human
  interaction.  A common means of doing this is provide a file with
  commands to read in it rather than typing directly.  While nothing in
  `list_main' appears to allow for this, with a few command line tricks
  we can replace typed input with the contents of the file. Such as
  below where a *pipe |* is used.

  ,----
  | > gcc -o list_main list_funcs.c list_main.c
  |
  | > cat commands.txt              # show contents of commands.txt file
  | insert rolf
  | insert kermit
  | insert fozzy
  | print
  | get 2
  | get 7
  | contains kermit
  | contains scooter
  | delete scooter
  | exit
  |
  | > cat commands.txt | ./list_main     # use commands.txt as input for list_main
  | Linked List Demo
  | Commands:
  |   print:          shows the current contents of the list
  |   clear:          eliminates all elements from the list
  |   exit:           exit the program
  |   insert thing:   inserts the given string into the list
  |   get index:      get the item at the given index
  |   contains thing: determine if the given thing is in the list
  |                   (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
  |
  | list> list> list> list> 0: fozzy    # several commands read, start of output
  | 1: kermit
  | 2: rolf
  |
  | list> 2: rolf                       # another command read but not printed
  |
  | list> index 7 out of bounds for list size 3
  | out of bounds
  |
  | list> 'kermit' is present
  |
  | list> not found
  |
  | list> unknown command delete
  |
  | list> unknown command scooter
  `----

  Clearly `list_main' is doing something above but it is hard to
  determine what because the commands being read are not printed, a
  feature known as *command echoing*.

  Sprinkled throughout the `list_main.c' code are `printf' statements
  based on the variable `echo' declared near the top of `main'.  This
  `echo' variable is set at the top of `main' based on whether command
  line argument 1 is `-echo'.  When it is, all commands are printed as
  they are read. This is extremely useful in the present case as
  illustrated below.

  ,----
  | > gcc -o list_main list_funcs.c list_main.c    # compile
  |
  | > cat commands.txt                             # show commands
  | insert rolf
  | insert kermit
  | insert fozzy
  | print
  | get 2
  | get 7
  | contains kermit
  | contains scooter
  | delete scooter
  | exit
  |
  | > cat commands.txt | ./list_main -echo         # use file as input, echo commands
  | Linked List Demo
  | Commands:
  |   print:          shows the current contents of the list
  |   clear:          eliminates all elements from the list
  |   exit:           exit the program
  |   insert thing:   inserts the given string into the list
  |   get index:      get the item at the given index
  |   contains thing: determine if the given thing is in the list
  |                   (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
  |
  | list> insert rolf                              # commands are echoed
  |
  | list> insert kermit
  |
  | list> insert fozzy
  |
  | list> print                                    # makes understanding behavior easier
  | 0: fozzy
  | 1: kermit
  | 2: rolf
  |
  | list> get 2
  | 2: rolf
  |
  | list> get 7
  | index 7 out of bounds for list size 3
  | out of bounds
  |
  | list> contains kermit
  | 'kermit' is present
  |
  | list> contains scooter
  | not found
  |
  | list> delete
  | unknown command delete
  |
  | list> scooter
  | unknown command scooter
  |
  | list> exit
  `----

  *You will need to know how to use command echoing in an assignment* so
  study how commands are printed carefully.

  To test your understanding, create another text file with commands in
  it for `list_main'.  Make this file at least 10 lines long with
  different commands such as `insert' and `get'.  Use the pipe technique
  shown to feed your commands to the `list_main' with the `-echo' option
  set. Show your results below.


OPTIONAL PRACTICE
=================

  For additional practice but no extra credit, implement a `int
  list_remove(list_t *list, char *query)' function and associated
  `remove' command to the list application.  Keep the following in mind.
  - Follow the convention that `list_remove()' returns an integer
    indicating no change was made (0) or something was removed (1)
  - Do not forget to alter the size of the `list_t' struct on removal.
  - You will need to call `free()' on the removed node to get rid of it
    but do so AFTER re-arranging pointers associated with it.
  - Don't forget special cases such as removing the first node in the
    list.
  This is a surprisingly tricky exercise to get the memory use
  right. You may wish to use valgrind to test whether your program has
  memory leaks or not. Ask a TA for help with this if it has not been
  discussed in class yet (valgrind WILL be discussed later).
